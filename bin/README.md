# `bin`

This is the original version of the binaries. The `testapp` and `testsuite` programs listed below are as initially provided to me, except for some minor modifications of full paths to relative paths to ensure portability. While the `testapp_forall` and `testsuite_forall` programs fulfil the vision of testing every single version available for a given module rather than just the default one, where defaultness is a setting on the cluster rather than in this framework, they rely on `module av` for parsing these available versions, thus adding significant computational overhead. However, the scripts could still be scavenged for how they facilitate logging, something that the binaries in [bin2](../bin2) do not yet do.

## Programs

- [testapp](#testapp): Tests the default version of a module
- [testapp_forall](#testapp_forall): Tests all versions of a module
- [testsuite](#testsuite): Tests the default version of each module in a profile
- [testsuite_forall](#testsuite_forall): Tests all versions of each module in a profile

### `testapp`

This program runs a test of the default version of a single module.

#### Syntax
```
Usage:  testapp [options] [tests ...] [-o sbatch_options ...]

Options:
  -l             list available tests
  -ll <test_name>                  
                 list module variables for test_name
  -v             verbose output (default)
  -q             quiet (no verbose output)
  -r             run tests on random, specifically-named nodes
  -k             keep raw output directories
  -t <path>      use path for temporary output directories

  -o             any additional SLURM sbatch options
                 (if present, must appear at the end of the command)

  --submit       dispatch asynchronous job
                 (prints <test_name> <job_id> <test_id>)
  --validate <test_name> <job_id> <test_id>
                 validate completed asynchronous job
  --status [ <test_name> | <job_id> ]              
                 you can leave out one or both of the options
                 check the status of a recently ran job

  Suggested usage:  testapp <testname>
```

By default, `./testapp` will search for available tests stored in the relative path `testsuite-main/testapps/`.

Every tests contains at least three files.
- `test.module`: Defines which modules are loaded
- `test.sub`: This is the bulk of the script where you tell how to run the application
- `test.out`: The expected output for the test
- `test.err`: Expected error file. Some applications print info in `stderr`
- (Optional) `test.pre`: Some tests also include a pre-submission script, e.g. the `intel` test has a `test.pre` script where the binary is compiled. This happens *before* the job is submitted.

There may be additional files such as input files or includes.

#### Updating tests or developing new tests

To update testapp (`matlab` in the below example), the first step is to navigate to the `testapps` folder and locate the module directory. 
```
$ cd testapps/matlab
```
In most cases, we can need to edit `test.module`, `test.out` and `test.err`. If the modified test runs without error and you want the change deployed for everyone, then you can upload it to this github repo, and create a pull request.

### `testapp_forall`

This program runs a test of all versions of a single module.

It runs `testapp <module_name>` for each available version obtained with `module av <module_name>`. The test executes for all versions regardless of whether it fails for some of them. The output to the terminal is saved as two separate `.log` files in the test folder: one for stdout and one for stderr. Each `.log` file is named using a timestamp of when the `testapp_forall` program began to execute.

#### Syntax
```
Usage:  testapp_forall [module_name] [redhat_version]
```

This is available for each package that has a test written. Red Hat versions this has been tested on are 7 and 8.

### `testsuite`

This program will automatically send many jobs to the cluster and periodically print the `PASS/FAIL` results as each test is run. The default version of each module will be used.

```
$ testsuite -h
Usage:  testsuite [options] [test profiles] [-o SLURM options]
Options:
         -l          list available tests
         -n          output any nodes which fail tests
         -k          keep testsuite/testapp output after tests have finished
                     (useful for seeing why they failed if working a problem)
         -v          verbose output (default)
         -q          quiet (no verbose output)
         -r          force all tests to be run on random nodes
         -R          force all test to NOT run on random nodes
         -o          options to pass directly to SLURM (not testapp)
                      (this option must come last, after the profile names)
```

#### Available profiles

All profiles are stored in `testsuite/profiles/`.
```
$ ./testsuite -l

#### Basic `testsuite` run

```

#### Submit jobs with other options

By default, all tests will be submitted to `batch` partition, but we can use other partitions to submit jobs by specifying the `-o` option in testsuite. `-o` allows you to add any slurm (sbatch/srun) options at the end of the testsuite command. The following command submits `testsuite` jobs in the `preempt` partition.
```
$ ./testsuite -o -p preempt 
```

### `testsuite_forall`

This program runs a test of all versions of each module in a given profile. `options` and `-o SLURM options` are currently unavailable for `testsuite_forall`.

Given that some modules on the HPC cluster have many versions, it may not be advisable to run the below with the `all` profile.
```
Usage:  testsuite_forall [profile] [redhat_version]
```

This is available for each package that has a test written. Red Hat versions this has been tested on are 7 and 8.
