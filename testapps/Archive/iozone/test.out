	Iozone: Performance Test of File I/O
	        Version $Revision: 3.465 $
		Compiled for 64 bit mode.
		Build: linux 

	Run began: ${*}

	Record Size 2048 kB
	File size set to 131072 kB
	Purge Mode On
	Command line used: ./iozone -i 0 -i 1 -r 2048 -s 131072 -p -t -f /scratch/${*}
	Output is in kBytes/sec
	Time Resolution = 0.000001 seconds.
	Processor cache size set to 1024 kBytes.
	Processor cache line size set to 32 bytes.
	File stride size set to 17 * record size.
	Throughput test with 8 processes
	Each process writes a 131072 kByte file in 2048 kByte records

	Children see throughput for  8 initial writers 	= ${*} kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for  8 initial writers 	= ${*} kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			= ${*} kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			= ${*} kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			= ${write_avg} kB/sec
	Min xfer 					= ${*} kB

	Children see throughput for  8 rewriters 	= ${*} kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for  8 rewriters 	= ${*} kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			= ${*} kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			= ${*} kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			= ${rewrite_avg} kB/sec
	Min xfer 					= ${*} kB

	Children see throughput for  8 readers 		= ${*} kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for  8 readers 		= ${*} kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			= ${*} kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			= ${*} kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			= ${read_avg} kB/sec
	Min xfer 					= ${*} kB

	Children see throughput for 8 re-readers 	= ${*} kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 8 re-readers 	= ${*} kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			= ${*} kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			= ${*} kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			= ${reread_avg} kB/sec
	Min xfer 					= ${*} kB



iozone test complete.
