This official DIRAC benchmark is in Python2, which none of our Anacondas
provide anymore.  CentOS 8 does provide /usr/bin/python2, so we could use
that for now.

There is a reworked Python3-compatible DIRAC benchmark at
	https://gitlab.cern.ch/giordano/DB12-cpp
but in my quick testing it behaved differently and gave very different
numbers (so needs tweaking/adjusting).

For now, I have taken a path of least resistance and switched the shebang
line to use /usr/bin/python2.
