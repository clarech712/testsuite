This benchmark uses Intel precompiled xhpl executable that only runs
on genuine Intel CPUs (and refuses to run on anything else).

We should probably add an entirely separate 'linpack_amd'.  AMD has a Spack
recipe how to build one:
	https://developer.amd.com/spack/hpl-benchmark/
so we can even have a modulefile for it.
