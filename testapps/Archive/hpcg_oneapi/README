This benchmark uses Intel precompiled xhpcg executable from oneAPI MKL
that no longer refuses to run on non-Intel CPUs.

We should probably also add an entirely separate 'hpcg_amd'.  AMD has a
Spack recipe for how to build one:
        https://developer.amd.com/spack/hpcg-benchmark/
so we can even have a modulefile for it.
