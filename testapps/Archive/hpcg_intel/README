This benchmark uses Intel precompiled xhpcg executable from MKL that
in the past ran on genuine Intel CPUs (and refused to run on anything else).
It no longer refuses to run on other CPUs now.

We should probably add an entirely separate 'hpcg_amd'.  AMD has a Spack
recipe for how to build one:
        https://developer.amd.com/spack/hpcg-benchmark/
so we can even have a modulefile for it.
